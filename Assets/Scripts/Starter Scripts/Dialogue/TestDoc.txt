[NAME=DONUT][SPEAKERSPRITE=Donut]Sir! A band of goblins broken in while you were gone!
[NAME=Rogue][SPEAKERSPRITE=Rouge]I see. They tore apart my book.
[NAME=DONUT][SPEAKERSPRITE=Donut]I'm sorry sir, your powers are gone now. I've let you down.
[NAME=ROGUE][SPEAKERSPRITE=Rouge]I still have some of my powers. I'll use them to retrieve the stolen pages and regain my full strength.
